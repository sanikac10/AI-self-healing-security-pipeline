# AI Self-Healing Security Pipeline

This project integrates two core components aimed at enhancing software security through automated vulnerability detection and remediation:

1. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanner and Remediation Agent**
2. **Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) Powered Vulnerable Code Scanner**

---

## 1. Dependency Vulnerability Scanner and Remediation Agent

### Overview

This component automates the process of identifying and remediating vulnerabilities in project dependencies.

### Features

* **Dependency Analysis**: Parses the `requirements.txt` file to build a comprehensive dependency tree.
* **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies known vulnerabilities within the dependencies.
* **Remediation Suggestions**: Provides recommended versions to patch the identified vulnerabilities.
* **Intuitive UI**: Presents findings through a user interface themed after Alcatraz prison, visually representing vulnerabilities at various depths in the dependency tree for contextual clarity.

### Usage

1. **Navigate to the Component Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd version-vul-fix-pipeline
   ```



2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



3. **Run the Scanner**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```



4. **Access the UI**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to interact with the visual representation of vulnerabilities.

## 2. Online Reinforcement Learning Powered Vulnerable Code Scanner

### Overview

This component employs online reinforcement learning to enhance the detection of vulnerable code segments within the codebase.

### Features

* **Heuristic Code Search**: Utilizes reinforcement learning to improve the search for known vulnerable code patterns.
* **Real-Time Learning**: Continuously refines its detection strategies by learning from new data.
* **GitHub Integration**: Cross-references findings with patched code segments from GitHub commits to identify and understand vulnerabilities.([GitHub][1])

### Usage

1. **Navigate to the Component Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd online-rl
   ```



2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



3. **Run the Scanner**:

   ```bash
   python rl_scanner.py
   ```
